# photo sharing kotlin app

A project to explore Kotlin and some MVP pattern. I'm most likely
going to abandon this because developing on it just isn't fun.
It's slow, I still get plenty of runtime errors and sometimes
annotation preprocessing or something else just doesn't seem
to work so I get weird shit like missing viewbinder classes,
failed injections and other random stuff that just wants me
`killall -9 java`.
